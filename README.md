# Project-7-NewsApp

NewsApp using the Guardian Api

Settings include the standard EditTextPreference and ListPreference, plus two custom preferences:
- NumberPicker preference, built after looking at verious sources online (most of which are specified in the about screen)
- DatePicker preference, built using Boston android version (link in the about sceen)

to both custom preferences I added a few things to save the user changes in the shared preference file of the app, and to show the right data on screen.
